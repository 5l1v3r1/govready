.SH "NAME"
govready - Commandline toolkit for SCAP configuration scanning and collaborative FISMA IT Compliance
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BI govready " <command> [args]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgovready\fR is a super easy to use commandline toolkit for running security scans on open source servers and software. Technically, \fBgovready\fR is a bash wrapper around OpenSCAP, a NIST certified SCAP toolkit.  \fBgovready\fR's workflow and user experience is similar to Git.
.PP
\fBgovready\fR will automatically install the required Linux libraries to run. Running 'govready init' will initialize the current directory to manage a sequence of security scans. The generated GovReadyfile stores various parameters for govready commands. \fBgovready\fR tries to make it easy to acquire and use SCAP-expressed machine-readable content, but you will need to tinker when using customized content.
